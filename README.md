# Natural Language Processing Projects

This repository contains two original research projects in computational linguistics:

1. [Machine Translation via Affine Maps](#1-machine-translation-via-affine-maps)  
2. [Language Similarity via Encoding Distances](#2-language-similarity-via-embedding-distances)

## 1. Machine Translation via Affine Maps

This project proposes a novel machine translation approach that uses linear affine maps between multilingual sentence representations, eliminating the need for full encoder-decoder retraining.

### Overview
- Uses pre-trained multilingual encoder embeddings (e.g., mBART50)
- Uses an affine transformation to transform the normal distributions of the source language features to match that of the target language features
- Decodes mapped embeddings with a target language decoder

## 2. Language Similarity via Embedding Distances

This project measures cross-linguistic similarity by analyzing the statistical properties of sentence embeddings generated by a multilingual model.

### Overview
- Sentence embeddings generated using the 600M parameter NLLB model
- Each language modeled as a multivariate normal distribution
- Pairwise similarity computed via entrywise average KL divergence

### File
- `Lang_Dist_KL_Div.ipynb`

## Requirements
